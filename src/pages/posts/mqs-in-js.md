## Intro: of islands and waterfalls...

One of the (many!) things I love about Astro is its embrace of [Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/). This means we deliver apps with the lightest possible baseline and progressively enhance them with repect to our users' context.

"Context" here can mean the state of the page load, a user's progress through the content, or their device's capabilities: Astro lets us [declaratively define
how a component should respond](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/component-hydration/#hydrate-interactive-components) via inline directives. Here's an example of how we can keep the mobile payload minimal by only hydrating a component if the device has the real estate to display it:

```astro
// Hydrate `Sidebar` only if the device is a tablet or larger
<Sidebar client:media={'(min-width: 768px)'} />
```

`<Sidebar />` shipping as inert HTML and only loading its JS if our user-focused criteria are met is great for performance – after all, the fastest code is the code you don't load!

### But wait...

Okay, so fast-by-default is very cool but...

🤔 if `matchMedia` is now a control mechanism for behaviour, then...\
😟 we need to keep our media queries aligned with our application code, so...\
😱 how do we keep CSS in sync with our JS?!

Manually keeping track of both across a large application under heavy development sounds bound to be brittle and bug-prone, but here's how to create a maintainable single source of truth in just three steps _and_ get friendlier CSS into the bargain 😀

## Step 1: Define your breakpoints

```js
// src/theme.cjs
const breakpoints = {
  small: 640,
  medium: 768,
  large: 960,
};

function getCustomMedia(breakpoints, mqs = {}) {
  for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(breakpoints)) {
    mqs[`--mq-${key}`] = `(min-width: ${val}px)`;
  }
  return mqs;
}

module.exports = {
  breakpoints,
  customMedia: getCustomMedia(breakpoints),
};
```

The exported value now includes `customMedia`, a map of `mediaQueryString`s derived from the keys and values of `breakpoints`:

```js
{
  breakpoints: {...}, // as above
  customMedia: {
    '--mq-small': '(min-width: 640px)',
    '--mq-medium': '(min-width: 768px)',
    '--mq-large': '(min-width: 960px)'
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Getting JS to talk to CSS

So now we've defined some breakpoints in JS... but how to access to them in CSS?

This is where Astro's first class support for PostCSS shines: adding a `postcss.config.cjs` file is the only set-up required:

```js
// postcss.config.js
const postcssCustomMedia = require("postcss-custom-media");
const { customMedia } = require("./src/theme.cjs");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    postcssCustomMedia({ importFrom: { customMedia } })
  ];
};
```

With that, Astro now pipes all our style rules through our new PostCSS pipeline so that the keys from `customMedia` are available to our CSS as named breakpoints.

Here's a trivial example that changes an element's background colour based on the dimensions of the viewport:

```scss
// src/styles/styles.scss
.my-component {
  --bg: blue;
  background-color: var(--bg);

  @media (--mq-medium) {
    --bg: green;
  }
  @media (--mq-large) {
    --bg: yellow;
  }
}
```

> [Custom Media Queries](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#at-ruledef-custom-media) are such natural-looking syntax that it can be easy to forget that they aren't yet native CSS, only a Stage 1 proposal. For now though, it's pretty cool that such a neat feature is so easily enabled.

## Step 3: Bringing it all together

Now we can access the same `customMedia` object in both JS and CSS from a single shared definition: here `--mq-medium` is used to define both the behaviour of
`<Sidebar />` and the layout of `.app` within the same Astro component

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import * as module from "module";
const moduleRequire = module.createRequire(import.meta.url);
const { customMedia } = moduleRequire('../theme.cjs');
---

<div class="app">
  <div class="app__content">...</div>
  <div class="app__sidebar">
    <Sidebar client:media={customMedia["--mq-medium"]} /> <!-- Reference 1 -->
  </div>
</div>

<style lang="scss">
.app {
  display: grid;

  @media (--mq-medium) {  // <-- Reference 2
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 240px;
    grid-template-areas: "content sidebar";
  }
}

.app__content {
  grid-area: content;
}

.app__sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
</style>
```

> The somewhat convoluted import from `theme.cjs` is due to the incomplete transition from CommonJS to ESM currently rippling through the JS ecosystem. This is being worked on: watch this space!

## Wrapping up

Hopefully you'll find this is a useful technique and a good illustration of the way Astro lends itself to delivering more user-centered applications at the same time as providing an amazing developer experience.

For a worked-up example of this approach in action head over to Github and [check out the source of this site](https://github.com/oliverturner/blog):
you'll see that I'm also using the `postcss-custom-properties` plugin to export the same `breakpoints` to static CSS for setting values like the maximum width of content.
