## The fastest code is the code you don't load

One of the (many!) things I love about Astro is its embrace of Island
Architecture as a way to deliver apps with the lightest possible baseline and
progressively enhance them in accordance with our user's context.

"Context" here can mean the state of the page load, the user's progress through
the content, or their device's dimensions: Astro lets us [declaratively define
how a component should respond](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/component-hydration/#hydrate-interactive-components)
via directives.

Here's an example of how we can keep the payload to mobile users minimal by
only loading the code and data for a component if their device has the real
estate to display it:

```astro
// Hydrate `Sidebar` only if the device is a tablet or larger
<Sidebar client:media={'(min-width: 768px)'} />
```
So `<Sidebar />` ships as inert HTML, and only gets to lazily pull in additional
resources if the criteria we define are met

### But wait...
Okay, so automagic performance sounds very cool but...\
ðŸ¤”â€ƒif `matchMedia` is now a control mechanism for behaviour, then...\
ðŸ˜Ÿâ€ƒwe need to keep our media queries aligned with our application code, so...\
ðŸ˜±â€ƒhow do we keep CSS in sync with our JS?!

Manually keeping track of both across a large application under heavy development
sounds bound to be brittle and bug-prone, but here's how to create a maintainable
single source of truth in just three steps _and_ get friendlier CSS into the
bargain ðŸ˜€

## Step 1: Define your breakpoints
```js
// src/theme.cjs
const breakpoints = {
  small: 640,
  medium: 768,
  large: 960
};

function getCustomMedia(breakpoints, mqs = {}) {
  for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(breakpoints)) {
    mqs["--mq-" + key] = `(min-width: ${val}px)`;
  }
  return mqs;
}

module.exports = {
  breakpoints,
  customMedia: getCustomMedia(breakpoints),
};
```

The exported value includes the purely numeric `breakpoints` plus `customMedia`,
a map of named media queries that share the same keys and values:

```js
{
  breakpoints: {...}, // as above
  customMedia: {
    '--mq-small': '(min-width: 640px)',
    '--mq-medium': '(min-width: 768px)',
    '--mq-large': '(min-width: 960px)'
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Getting JS to talk to CSS

So now we've defined some breakpoints in JS... but how to access to them in CSS?

This is where Astro's first class support for PostCSS shines: adding a
`postcss.config.cjs` file is the only set-up required to access the power and
flexibility of its ecosystem:

```js
// postcss.config.js
const postcssCustomMedia = require("postcss-custom-media");
const { customMedia } = require("./src/theme.cjs");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    postcssCustomMedia({ importFrom: { customMedia } })
  ];
};
```

That's it: Astro now pipes all our style rules through PostCSS, meaning that now
we can use the prefixed `breakpoints` in our (S)CSS. Here's a trivial example
that changes an element's background colour based on the dimensions of the
viewport:

```scss
// src/styles/styles.scss
.my-component {
  --bg: blue;
  background-color: var(--bg);

  @media (--mq-medium) {
    --bg: green;
  }
  @media (--mq-large) {
    --bg: yellow;
  }
}
```

It's such natural-looking syntax that it's easy to forget that Custom Media
Queries _aren't_ yet native CSS, only a Stage 1 proposal. For now though, it's
pretty cool that such a neat feature is so easily enabled.

## Step 3: Bringing it all together

Because PostCSS also exposes the style object to JS, we can also use the same
key references throughout our components: here `--mq-medium` is used to defined
both the behaviour of `<Sidebar />` and the layout of `.app`

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import { customMedia } from '../../theme.cjs'
---

<div class="app">
  <div class="app__content">...</div>
  <div class="app__sidebar">
    <!-- Reference 1 -->
    <Sidebar client:media={customMedia["--mq-medium"]} />
  </div>
</div>

<style lang="scss">
.app {
  display: grid;

  // Reference 2
  @media (--mq-medium) {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 240px;
    grid-template-areas: "content sidebar";
  }
}

.app__content {
  grid-area: content;
}

.app__sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
</style>
```

## Conclusion
Hopefully this is a useful technique and an illustrative example of how Astro's
architecture lends itself to delivering more user-centered applications at the
same time as providing an amazing developer experience.
